##**Overview**
Attire Advisor is a cutting-edge clothing recommendation system that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyze user-uploaded images and suggest outfits that match the detected clothing items. Initially focused on image-based input, Attire Advisor recommends similar styles and complementary pieces. Future iterations of the project will expand to include additional inputs, such as occasion and personal style preferences, allowing for more tailored recommendations.

## **Project Goals**
Image-Based Recommendations: Use CNNs to analyze images and suggest outfits that align with the user's current style.
Enhanced Personalization: Future versions will incorporate inputs like occasion, weather, and personal style to refine outfit suggestions.
User-Friendly Interface: Develop an intuitive platform where users can easily upload images and receive outfit recommendations.
---
## **Current Features**
Image Upload: Users can upload an image of their outfit or a specific clothing item.
CNN-Based Analysis: The system uses a Convolutional Neural Network to analyze the uploaded image and identify clothing items.
Style Matching: Based on the analysis, the system suggests outfits that match the detected style and clothing type.
Outfit Gallery: A collection of suggested outfits that users can browse, based on their image input.
---
## **Future Features**
Occasion-Based Filters: Allow users to specify the occasion (e.g., casual, business, formal) to refine recommendations.
Style Customization: Include inputs for personal style preferences, such as color choices, preferred brands, and clothing types.
Weather Integration: Integrate real-time weather data to suggest weather-appropriate outfits.
Shopping Links: Provide direct links to online stores for purchasing recommended items.

## **Dataset**
Fashion Dataset: The model is trained on a large dataset of fashion images, categorized by type, style, and occasion.
User Images: Collected through user uploads to generate personalized outfit recommendations.


---
## **Model Architecture**
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): The core of the Attire Advisor's recommendation system, designed to extract features from fashion images.
Feature Extraction: The CNN model extracts features from the uploaded image, such as color, pattern, and clothing type.
Style Matching Algorithm: Compares extracted features with the fashion dataset to find the closest style matches.
